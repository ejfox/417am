# Starter Template
This is a basic but opinionated starting point for prototyping apps, with an emphasis on data handling and visualization.

# Getting started
Edit project configuration in `options.json`.

`npm start` to start gulp

Edit coffeescript in `src/coffee/app.coffee`

Edit HTML in `src/tmpl/index.mustache`

Edit Stylus (CSS) in `src/styl/style.styl`
